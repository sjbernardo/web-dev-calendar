            Bonifacio Day is a national holiday in the Philippines, commemorating Andrés Bonifacio, 
            one of the country's national heroes. He was the founder and eventual Supremo of the 
            Katipunan, a secret society that triggered the Philippine Revolution of 1896 against 
            the Spanish Empire. It is celebrated every November 30, the birth anniversary of Bonifacio. 
            It also coincides with the feast day of Saint Andrew the Apostle, from whom Bonifacio's 
            given name was derived, as he was born on such day.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Since 1901, Bonifacio's birthday has been celebrated by civic organizations. By 1920, Senator Lope 
            K. Santos filed a bill to declare November 30 a holiday. In 1921, the governor general approved 
            the bill as Act No. 2946. The law did not name Bonifacio and added November 30 to the list of 
            holidays listed at Act No. 2711. In time, it became a holiday to commemorate all Filipino heroes; 
            this persisted even when a separate National Heroes' Day holiday was declared in 1931. In 1942, 
            November 30 was declared as National Heroes' Day. In 1952, by that time, the now-independent 
            Philippines, President Elpidio Quirino separated National Heroes' Day and Bonifacio Day by an 
            executive order. Quirino explained in a speech at the National Teachers College that the 
            "change has become necessary because of the interest from different sectors of our country to 
            celebrate each hero's anniversary in order to perpetuate his name."
            <br><br>
            Unlike Rizal Day which is held on the death anniversary of José Rizal, Bonifacio Day is 
            celebrated on his birth date. This is because of the controversial events on which Bonifacio 
            was executed by his fellow revolutionaries during the time of the Philippine Revolution.

        <h2>Ceremonies</h2>
        <p>
            Bonifacio Day ceremonies are usually held at the Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan, and is usually 
            led by the incumbent president. It is also held at places with significance to Bonifacio, 
            especially other monuments of him.
