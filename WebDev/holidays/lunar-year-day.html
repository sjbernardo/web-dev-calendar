        <h2>What Do People Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Filipino-Chinese communities in the Philippines celebrate Lunar New Year every year in hope of 
            attracting prosperity, closer family ties and peace. Most Filipino-Chinese families usually clean 
            their homes thoroughly, prepare lucky money in red envelopes, serve sweet foods and display various 
            food and fruits on a table, which is believed to invite good fortune. People also participate in 
            parades and dragon dances that are organized in China Towns in different cities in the Philippines.
        </p>

        <h2>Public Life</h2>
        <p>
            Lunar New Year is not an official holiday in the Philippines so all establishments remain open. 
            However, some streets in several China Towns in different cities may be closed to honor this celebration.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Small Chinese communities existed in the Philippines since the Spanish regime, which lasted for more 
            than 300 years dating back from the 16th century. As time progressed, the Chinese communities grew 
            due to intermarriage among Filipino natives and other races, including the Chinese. As the population 
            grew, so did the grandeur of the Lunar New Year celebration.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lawmakers have proposed to make the Lunar New Year a legal public holiday. However, there is still 
            debate that adding another holiday in the Philippines could be detrimental to the economy due to the 
            increasing holiday incentives. The Republic Act 9492 dictates that for every legal non-working holiday, 
            all working establishments should give incentives or overtime pay to their employees.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            The mythological Chinese dragon is the main symbol of Lunar New Year. Other symbols include 
            firecrackers that are believed to drive off bad luck and the Tikoy, a Chinese sticky sweet treat 
            that symbolizes the attraction of good luck.
