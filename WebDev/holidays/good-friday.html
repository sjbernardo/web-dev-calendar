        <h2>What Do People Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Good Friday is a part of the religious holiday week in the lead up to Easter Sunday in the Philippines. 
            This is the time when many Filipinos refrain from engaging in worldly activities such as listening to 
            loud music or drinking alcohol. Most Catholics refrain from eating meat during this day and engage in 
            fasting and prayer.
            <br><br>
            Many people also attend church services and take part in the Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ or the 
            Station of the Cross.  The Station of The Cross depicts the last hours of the Passion of Jesus, and 
            the Filipinos use these stations to meditate on Jesusâ€™ sufferings. Some men in different localities 
            in the Philippines re-enact the penance of Jesus Christ by going as far as crucifying themselves on 
            the cross.
            <br><br>
            Masses (church services) are also held in the church before 3pm (or 15:00) local time since this 
            symbolizes the time that Jesus Christ died on the cross. Once the clock strikes 3pm (15:00), people 
            observe this moment in silence and solemnity. Good Friday is a time when people take part in a form 
            of penance to repent from their sins. Some Filipinos spend time at the beach during the holiday.

        <h2>Public Life</h2>
        <p>
            Government offices, schools and most major establishments such as shopping malls are closed on 
            Good Friday. Holiday destinations such as beaches and hotels are busy with tourists and travelers. 
            Public transport is reduced so those wishing to travel will need to plan ahead of time.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            The Philippines used to be a pagan country, in which people believed in spirits. When the Spanish 
            came to spread Christianity during the 15th century, many Filipinos were converted to Christianity. 
            The Spaniards made a show of having processions and mass celebrations to entice Filipinos to embrace 
            Christianity. This marked the origins of the Good Friday observance in the Philippines. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            Good Friday is symbolized by the cross, as it commemorates the belief that Jesus Christ suffered and 
            sacrificed his own life to save humanity.
