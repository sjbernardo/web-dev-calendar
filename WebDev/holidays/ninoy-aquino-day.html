            Ninoy Aquino Day is a national non-working holiday in the Philippines observed annually on 
            August 21 commemorating the assassination of former Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr., the 
            husband of Corazon Aquino, who later became the eleventh Philippine President. His assassination 
            led to the downfall of the tenth president, dictator, and kleptocrat Ferdinand Marcos, which
            ultimately resulted in the People Power Revolution on February 25, 1986. Since 2004, a commemoration 
            ceremony is traditionally held that was attended by presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Fidel V. 
            Ramos and Benigno Aquino III.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Aquino was a well-known opposition figure and critic of the then-President Ferdinand Marcos. 
            Due to his beliefs, he was later imprisoned for about eight years after martial law was declared 
            in the Philippines. Even in his imprisonment, he sought a parliamentary seat for Metro Manila in 
            the Interim Batasang Pambansa under the banner of the Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN) in 1978. He eventually 
            led in the opinion polls and was initially leading the electoral count but eventually lost to the 
            Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) slate led by First Lady Imelda Marcos. Aquino remained in prison but 
            continued to fight for democracy in the country and against the oppression of the Filipino people. 
            After suffering from a heart attack in March 1980, he and his family moved to the United States for 
            medical treatment, eventually leading to his self-imposed exile for about three years. There, he 
            continued his advocacy by giving speeches to the Filipino-American communities.
            <br><br>
            Later, he planned to return to the Philippines to challenge Marcos for the parliamentary elections 
            in 1984. Though some did not feel this was a good idea, he still did so in 1983. Upon returning to 
            the country at Manila International Airport (now renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his 
            honor), he was shot and killed on August 21, 1983, as he was escorted off an airplane by security 
            personnel. This led to several protests at his funeral that sparked snap presidential elections in 
            1986, which led to the People Power Revolution, catapulting his wife, Corazon Aquino, to the presidency.
