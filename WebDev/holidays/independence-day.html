            One of the most significant dates in the Philippine’s history is Independence Day because it 
            marks the nation’s independence from the Spanish rule on June 12, 1898. Filipinos celebrate it 
            annually on June 12.
        </p>
        <h2>What Do People Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Independence Day is a day when many people, including government officials, employees, and students, 
            participate in nationwide parades.  However, the main highlight is the police and military parade 
            in Manila headed by the country’s incumbent president, followed by a speech and a 21-gun salute.  
            Many Filipinos spend the day in parks and malls. Many Filipino communities in other countries also 
            observe the nation’s Independence Day celebrations.
            <br><br>
            The elderly encourage children to jump at the stroke of midnight so that they would grow up tall. 
            Many people display 12 circular fruits and wear clothing with polka dots to symbolize money. It is 
            also popular practice to open all the doors and windows at the stroke of midnight to let in the 
            good luck. Many Filipino families also read the Christian bible and attend a church midnight mass. 
            It is common for many Filipinos to blend religion and superstition in celebrating New Year’s Day.

        <h2>Public Life</h2>
        <p>
            The Philippine’s Independence Day is a national holiday so government offices are closed.  
            There are absolutely no classes in all schools.  Many business establishments are closed except
            shopping centers. Public transport such as buses, passenger jeeps, and tricycles still operate 
            but their routes may be limited due to the closure of streets used for parades.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            The annual June 12 observance of Philippine’s Independence Day came into effect after past President 
            Diosdado Macapagal signed the Republic Act No. 4166 regarding this matter on August 4, 1964.  This 
            Act legalized the holiday, which is based on the Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898 by 
            General Emilio Aguinaldo and Filipino revolutionary forces from the Spanish colonization.  The 
            Philippines’ flag was raised and its national anthem was played for the first time in 1898.  
            However, liberty was short-lived because Spain and the United States did not recognize the declaration.
            <br><br>
            The 1898 Treaty of Paris ended the war between Spain and the United States. Spain surrendered the 
            entire archipelago comprising the Philippines to the United States.  The Philippines started a revolt 
            against the United States in 1899 and achieved national sovereignty on July 4, 1946, through the 
            Treaty of Manila.  Independence Day was officially observed on July 4 until the Republic Act No. 
            4166, which set out to move the holiday to June 12, was approved on August 4, 1964.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            The Flag of the Republic of the Philippines, representing the country is symbolized by the following:
            <ul><li>Royal blue field – peace, truth, and justice.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Scarlet red field – patriotism and valor.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>White triangle – equality and brotherhood. </li></ul>
            <ul><li>Three stars on the corners of the triangle – the three main geographical regions of the country namely Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>The sun at the center of the triangle – has eight rays representing the eight Philippine provinces that started the revolt against Spain.</li></ul>
            The flag is seen in various places across towns and cities in the Philippines during the country’s 
            Independence Day.  Many cars also sport miniature flags on this day.
