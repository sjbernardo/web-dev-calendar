            Rizal Day <i>(Spanish: Día de Rizal, Filipino: Araw ni Rizal)</i> is a Philippine national holiday 
            commemorating life and works of José Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines. It is celebrated 
            every December 30, the anniversary of Rizal's 1896 execution at Bagumbayan (present-day Rizal Park) 
            in Manila.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Rizal Day was first instituted with a decree dated December 20, 1898 signed by President Emilio 
            Aguinaldo in Malolos, Bulacan, celebrating December 30, 1898 as a national day of mourning for 
            Rizal and all the victims of the Spanish colonial rule of the Philippines. Daet, Camarines Norte 
            was the first town to follow the decree, building a monument designed by Lt. Col. Antonio Sanz, 
            led by Sanz and Lt. Col. Ildefonso Alegre, and financed by the townsfolk of Camarines Norte and 
            the rest of the Bicol Region. Finished in February 1899, the three-tiered stone pylon 
            inscribing Rizal's novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, and Morga, for Antonio de Morga,
            author of Sucesos de las islas Filipinas, a book about the early days of the Spanish colonization 
            in the Philippines.
            <br><br>
            With the victory of the Americans against the Spaniards in the Spanish–American War, the Americans 
            took control of the Philippines. In an effort to demonstrate that they were more pro-Filipino than 
            the Spaniards, the American Governor-General William Howard Taft in 1901 named Rizal a Philippine 
            national hero. A year later, on February 1, 1902, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 345, 
            which made December 30 a public holiday.

        <h2>Ceremonies</h2>
        <p>
            Rizal Day ceremonies are held at Rizal Park in Manila. This is usually held early in the morning, 
            led by the president and vice president, and involves the raising of the national flag at Independence 
            Flagpole, followed by a flypast by the Philippine Air Force and the laying of a wreath at the Rizal 
            Monument. The president also usually has a year-end address that is first broadcast on this holiday.
            <br><br>

            Rites are also held elsewhere in the country, with the chief executive of a province, city, or 
            town presiding. These rites are similar to the one in Manila, and most often include flag-raising, 
            speeches, and wreath-laying ceremony at the locale's own monument to Rizal.
