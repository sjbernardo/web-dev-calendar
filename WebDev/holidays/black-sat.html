                Holy Saturday commemorates the day that Jesus Christ lay in the tomb after his death, 
                according to the Christian bible. It is the day after Good Friday and the day before Easter Sunday. 
                It is also known as Easter Eve, Easter Even, Black Saturday, or the Saturday before Easter.
                <br><br>
                Black Saturday is a public holiday. It is a day off for the general population, and schools and 
                most businesses are closed.
                <br><br>
                In 2025, it falls on a Saturday, and some businesses may choose to follow Saturday opening hours.

                In the predominantly <b>Catholic Philippines</b>, the day is legally and colloquially known as 
                Black Saturday, given the colour's role in mourning. It commemorates the day that Jesus 
                lay in his tomb. Traditional taboos from the previous day are carried over and are 
                sometimes broken; swimming is allowed in the afternoon. Most commercial establishments 
                resume operations, with smaller enterprises remaining closed until or before Easter. 
                Television and radio stations broadcast on shorter hours with special programming or remain 
                off-air.
