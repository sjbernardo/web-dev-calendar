                New Year’s Eve is one of the largest global celebrations because it marks the last day of the year
                in the Gregorian calendar, December 31, before the New Year. Count down to the New Year no matter 
                where you are in the world.

                In the Philippines, New Year's Eve <i>(Bisperas ng Bagong Taon)</i> is a special non-working holiday 
                (except for 2021 and 2022, where it is a special working holiday),[40] and Filipinos usually 
                celebrate in the company of family or close friends. Traditionally, most households would attend 
                church for year-end services and afterwards, host or attend an abundant midnight feast called the 
                Medianoche. Typical dishes include pancit (a noodle dish meant to symbolize for a longer life) 
                and hamón (dry-cured ham), while lechon (roasted pig) is usually prepared as is barbecued food 
                and various desserts. Some refrain from serving chicken, as their scratching and pecking for food 
                is said to be an unlucky idiom for a hand-to-mouth existence. Many Filipinos also buy firecrackers 
                and fireworks to be used in New Year's Eve, which is believed to drive away any bad luck in the 
                start of the new year.
                <br><br>
                Many opt to wear new, bright, or colorful clothes with circular patterns, such as polka dots, or 
                display sweets and twelve round fruits in the belief that circles attract money, while candies 
                represent a sweeter year ahead. Several customs must be done exactly at midnight: scattering coins 
                to increase wealth in the coming year, jumping to increase height, or the Spanish custom of eating 
                twelve grapes, one for each month of the year. Filipinos also make loud noises by blowing on 
                cardboard or plastic horns called torotot, banging on pots and pans, playing loud music, blowing 
                car horns, or by lighting firecrackers and bamboo cannons. It is an apotropaic ritual, as the din 
                is believed to scare away bad luck and evil spirits.

                Although many Filipinos typically spend their New Year's Eve at their family homes, in some urban 
                areas, many New Year's Eve parties and countdown celebrations are also hosted by the private sector 
                with the help of the local
