                Christmas Day, on December 25, is one of the most festive Christian holidays in many countries 
                around the world. It celebrates Jesus' birth.

            <h2>Christmas traditions</h2>
            <p>
                Christmas Day in the Philippines is primarily a family affair. The Misa de Gallo is celebrated 
                on December 25 and is usually one of several Masses that all family members (including non-churchgoers)
                are present and is often celebrated between 10 pm and midnight, a schedule preferred by many Filipinos 
                who stay up late on Christmas Eve for the night-long celebration of the Noche Buena. Fireworks and 
                most merrymaking devices are sometimes used at the start of Christmas.
                <br><br>
                Preferably in the morning, Filipinos typically visit their extended family, especially to pay 
                their respects to senior relatives. This custom of giving respect is enacted through the "Págmamáno". 
                A supplicant takes the back of an elder's hand and presses it against the forehead while giving the 
                greeting, Máno, pô (lit. "[Thy] hand, please"). The elder often responds by reciting a blessing 
                or simply acknowledging the gesture, and in return gives "Aguinaldo" or money in the form of crisp 
                banknotes, often placed in a sealed envelope such as an ang pao. Godparents, in particular, are 
                socially obligated to give presents or aguinaldo to their godchildren, to whom they often give 
                larger amounts compared to other younger relatives.
                <br><br>
                A festive lunch may follow the "Págmamáno". The menu is heavily dependent upon the finances of the 
                family, with richer families preparing grand feasts while poorer families choose to cook simple yet 
                special dishes. Some families choose to open presents on this day after the lunch.
                <br><br>
                When nighttime falls, members of the family usually return home or linger to drink, play parlor games, 
                and chat. Some may opt to have another feast for dinner, while a minority spend the entire day at 
                home to rest after the previous days' festivities.
