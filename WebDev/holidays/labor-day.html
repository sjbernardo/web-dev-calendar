            In the <b>Philippines</b>, Labor Day is a public holiday commemorated nationwide on 1 May. Initially 
            observed in 1903 through a protest by the Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina in Manila during the 
            American colonial era, it was officially recognised as a holiday in 1908, with the first 
            official commemoration taking place in 1913.
