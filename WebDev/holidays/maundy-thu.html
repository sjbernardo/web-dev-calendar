        <h2>What Do People Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Maundy Thursday marks the event before Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross. Aside from fasting, 
            most Filipinos refrain from activities such as drinking alcohol, eating meat and intercourse with 
            their partners. Maundy Thursday is highlighted by the re-enactment of the Last Supper, which is 
            organized by churches. It is customary for Filipinos to visit seven churches on this particular day. 
            This is called Visita Iglesia which is a Spanish word for “to visit churches”. Some people visit 14 
            churches to symbolize the 14 stations of the cross.
        </p>

        <h2>Public Life</h2>
        <p>
            Maundy Thursday is a public holiday in the Philippines. Most businesses are closed from Maundy 
            Thursday until Black Saturday (also known as Holy Saturday). Television and radio stations also 
            closed during this time but they do pre-programmed broadcast special shows that are themed for 
            the Easter holiday period. Cable channels continue their normal programs.
            <br><br>
            Public transport is reduced but there are some public transport services that operate during this 
            time of the year. Those who work on Maundy Thursday get paid double as stipulated in the Labor Code 
            of the Philippines.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Holy Week was a tradition that was integrated into the Filipino society during the Spanish regime. 
            Since then, Filipinos have been commemorating this day as an important religious holiday. Maundy 
            Thursday was declared as an official holiday when the Republic Act (RA) 9492 was drafted on July 24,
            2006. timeanddate.com has more information on Maundy Thursday’s observance on a global level and how 
            the Easter date is determined.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            An important Maundy Thursday symbol is the concept of the Holy Eucharist, which is evident in the 
            re-enactment of the Last Supper scene that depicts the last day before Jesus Christ was crucified
            on the cross.
