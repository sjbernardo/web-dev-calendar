            Many Christian communities around the world annually observe the Feast of the Immaculate Conception 
            on December 8. This day is a holy day of obligation in which many Christians, particularly of the 
            Catholic faith, attend special church services for this occasion.

            The Immaculate Conception is the belief that the Virgin Mary was free of original sin from the 
            moment of her conception. It is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church. Debated 
            by medieval theologians, it was not defined as a dogma until 1854, by Pope Pius IX in the papal bull 
            Ineffabilis Deus. While the Immaculate Conception asserts Mary's freedom from original sin, the 
            Council of Trent, held between 1545 and 1563, had previously affirmed her freedom from personal sin.
            <br><br>
            The Immaculate Conception became a popular subject in literature, but its abstract nature meant 
            it was late in appearing as a subject in works of art. The iconography of Our Lady of the Immaculate 
            Conception shows Mary standing, with arms outstretched or hands clasped in prayer. The feast day 
            of the Immaculate Conception is December 8.
            <br><br>
            Many Protestant churches rejected the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception as unscriptural, 
            though some Anglicans accept it as a pious devotion. Opinions on the Immaculate Conception 
            in Oriental Orthodoxy are divided: Shenouda III, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and the 
            Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I of the Syriac Orthodox Church opposed the teaching, while the 
            Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church accept it.
