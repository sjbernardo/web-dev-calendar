            National Heroes Day <i>(Filipino: Pambansang Araw ng mga Bayani)</i> is a public holiday in the 
            Philippines celebrated annually on the last Monday of August as a tribute to Filipino Heroes.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The holiday traces its roots to the Cry of Pugad Lawin in August 1896, which marked the beginning of 
            the Philippine Revolution. The date and the location of the cry has been long disputed. From 1911 
            to 1962, the cry was thought to have emanated from Balintawak (now in modern-day Balingasa, Quezon City)
            on August 26. On 1963, by recommendation of historian Teodoro Agoncillo, the date was changed to 
            August 23, and the location was changed to Pugad Lawin in Caloocan (now in modern day Gulod, 
            Novaliches, Quezon City). Due to disputed date, and with the consensus that the cry occurred in 
            late August, the holiday was then set in the last week of August.
            <br><br>
            The observance of National Heroes Day was already present during the American colonial period. 
            Act No. 3827 by the Philippine Legislature enacted on October 28, 1931, designated every last 
            Sunday of August as National Heroes Day. However, Bonifacio Day established by virtue of Act 
            No. 2946 of 1921 was also dedicated to anonymous Filipino heroes. In practice, National Heroes 
            Day celebrations were observed on the same day as Bonifacio Day. This continued during the Japanese 
            occupation during World War II and some years after the United States granted the Philippines 
            independence in 1946.
            <br><br>
            President Elpidio Quirino issued Administrative Order No. 190 in 1952 which reverted National 
            Heroes Day back to the last Sunday of August. Administrative Code of 1987 of President Corazon 
            Aquino designated the day as a regular holiday. The date of the holiday was revised again in 2007, 
            this time to the last Monday of August, via Republic Act No. 9492 which was signed into law by 
            President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
            <br><br>
            Later, he planned to return to the Philippines to challenge Marcos for the parliamentary elections 
            in 1984. Though some did not feel this was a good idea, he still did so in 1983. Upon returning to 
            the country at Manila International Airport (now renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his 
            honor), he was shot and killed on August 21, 1983, as he was escorted off an airplane by security 
            personnel. This led to several protests at his funeral that sparked snap presidential elections in 1986, 
            which led to the People Power Revolution, catapulting his wife, Corazon Aquino, to the presidency.

        <h2>Commemoration</h2>
        <p>
            The law itself does not explicitly name any specific individual to be commemorated during National 
            Heroes Day. Commemorations often include key figures in Philippine history who are regarded as
            national heroes though it could also include "lesser-known" and "ordinary" Filipinos.
            Examples include Overseas Filipino Workers[ and frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
