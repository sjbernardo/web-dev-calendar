            People Power Anniversary is a nationwide observance and school holiday in the Philippines each year. 
            This event holds a special place in the hearts of many Filipinos as they remember a revolution that 
            restored democracy in the Philippines in 1986.
        </p>
        <h2>What Do People Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Many people celebrate People Power Anniversary by wearing yellow, which was the official color of 
            the LABAN party, the rival political group that challenged the government back in 1986. Much of the 
            festivities and activities occur in the city of Manila, particularly Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue
            (EDSA), a major public road where people flock to visit. Activities include programs such as church 
            masses and concerts.
            <br><br>
            Many people also flash the LABAN (fight) sign, which is an “L” sign using one’s index finger and thumb.  
            Media stations broadcast programs about the event through a live feed of street celebrations, 
            documentaries about the revolution, and interviews with prominent political figures and personalities. 
            The print media publish news and feature articles on stories related to this event.
        </p>

        <h2>Public Life</h2>
        <p>
            People Power Anniversary in the Philippines is a school holiday only, so both public and private 
            schools are closed. Business remains open on this day. There is less traffic, especially in cities, 
            on this day, giving commuters a chance to enjoy a brief respite from rush hour traffic woes. There is 
            no disruption of services in public and mass transport systems, with regular routes and schedules 
            remaining intact.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            The story behind People Power Anniversary traces back to events that occurred from February 22 to 25, 
            1986. Masses of disillusioned people, mainly from urban Manila, staged a revolution on the streets of
            Manila. This revolution eventually led to the downfall of a government that many people saw as corrupt 
            and oppressive.
            <br><br>
            A major road called EDSA, in Manila, was the stage for crucial events that occurred during the 
            revolution. Nearly two million people were protesting on this street at one point during this 
            historical event. Many Filipinos consider the holiday as historic and important because the revolution 
            changed and reformed the political system in the Philippines.
            <br><br>    
            People Power Anniversary was a working holiday on February 25 in previous years. It was not a day off 
            for work or schools but activities and ceremonies to celebrate the anniversary would continue to 
            occur. In 2009 the Monday nearest February 25 was declared a special holiday for all schools 
            (both public and private).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            Yellow symbolizes the revolution and also is the official color of the LABAN (fight) political party. 
            The “L” sign which is formed by one’s index finger and thumb is another symbol of the LABAN party and 
            the people’s defiance of the authoritarian government at the time of the revolution.
