            Christmas Eve, which is the day before Christmas Day, is celebrated in many countries worldwide. 
            It is a Christian observance that falls on December 24 in the Gregorian calendar.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The celebrations of Christmas in the Philippines have deep influences of Catholicism, tracing their 
            roots back to Spanish colonial rule from 1521 to 1898. Currently, the Philippines holds the longest 
            running festivity of the Christmas season in the world, which begins on September 1.

        <h2>Christmas traditions</h2>
        <p>
            For Catholic Filipinos, Christmas Eve ("Filipino: Bisperas ng Pasko"; Spanish: Víspera de Navidad) on 
            December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and the traditional Noche Buena (Filipino Spanish 
            "Good Night") feast. Family members dine together at around midnight. Some families would also 
            open presents at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Noche Buena</b><br>
            The Christmas dinner eaten around midnight on Christmas Eve is known as Noche Buena 
            (not to be confused with the New Year's Eve dinner known as Medianoche). 
            Common traditional dishes served for the meal include: lechón, various types of pancit (noodles), 
            Filipino spaghetti, hamonado, jamón, queso de bola, morcón, embutido, chicken galantina, almondigas 
            (meatballs), paelya (arroz valenciana, bringhe, etc.), lumpia, menudo, mechado, caldereta, callos, 
            chicken pastel, relyenong bangús (stuffed milkfish), lengua estofado, adobo, and various types of 
            barbecue (inihaw). Almost all of these dishes are eaten with white rice. Desserts and side dishes 
            include úbe halayá, turon, leche flan, macaroni salad, membrilyo, fruit salad, buko salad, crema de 
            fruta, ensaymada, champorado, mango float, fruitcake, castañas (roasted chestnuts), and various 
            other kakanin (rice cakes) like puto bumbong, bibingka, suman, biko, and sapin-sapin. Popular 
            beverages are tsokolate as well as coffee, soda, wine, beer, alcoholic drinks, and fruit juices.
        </p>

            <b>Panunulúyan</b><br>
            In different provinces and schools, the journey of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary in search of 
            lodging is re-enacted. The pageant, traditionally called the <i>"Panunulúyan"</i>, <i>"Pananawágan"</i>,
            or <i>"Pananapátan"</i>, is modeled after the Spanish Las Posadas.
            <br><br>
            The Panunulúyan is performed after dark, with the actors portraying Joseph and the Virgin 
            Mary going to pre-designated houses. They perform a chant meant to rouse the "owners of the house" 
            (also actors) to request for lodging. The owners then cruelly turn them away, sometimes also in 
            song, saying that their house is already filled with other guests. Finally, Joseph and Mary make 
            their way to the parish church where a replica of the stable is set up. The birth of Jesus is 
            celebrated at midnight with the Misa de Gallo.
