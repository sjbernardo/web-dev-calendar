                For Muslims around the world, Eid ul Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting 
                and prayer. It is one of the largest and most important celebrations in the Islamic calendar.
                <br><br>
                Eidul-Fitar is a public holiday. It is a day off for the general population, and schools and most 
                businesses are closed.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad instituted the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. According to 
                certain ahadith, these festivals were initiated in Medina after the migration of Muhammad from 
                Mecca. Anas ibn Malik, a companion of Muhammad, narrated that when Muhammad arrived in Medina, 
                he found people celebrating two specific days in which they entertained themselves with recreation. 
                Muhammad then remarked that God had fixed two mandatory days of festivity: Eid al-Fitr and Eid 
                al-Adha.

            <h2>Practices and culture in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>
                Among Muslim Filipinos in the Philippines, Eid al-Fitr is commonly known as <i>Hariraya</i>, <i>Buka</i>, 
                <i>Hariraya Buka</i>, or <i>Hariraya Buka Puasa</i>. "Eid al-" is often replaced with Eid'l in the country's 
                local English variant. It is also known as <i>Wakas ng Ramadan </i>("End of Ramadan"), 
                <i>Araw ng Raya</i> ("Feast Day"), or <i>Pagtatapos ng Pag-aayuno</i> ("End of the Fast") in 
                Filipino. It was proclaimed a legal holiday for Muslim Filipinos in 1977 by Presidential Decree 
                No. 1083. In 2002, this was upgraded to a public national holiday by Republic Act No. 9177. 
                It is also sometimes known by its Malay name "Hari Raya Puasa"; and by its Indonesian name 
                "Lebaran".
