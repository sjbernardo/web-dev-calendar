            All Saints' Day is a celebration of all Christian saints, particularly those who have no special 
            feast days of their own, in many Roman Catholic, Anglican and Protestant churches. In many western 
            churches it is annually held November 1 and in many eastern churches it is celebrated on the first 
            Sunday after Pentecost. It is also known as All Hallows Tide, All-Hallomas, or All Hallows' Day.

        <h2>Customs</h2>
        <p>
            Allhallowtide in the Philippines is variously called Undás (from the Spanish Honras, meaning 'honours', 
            as in "with honours"), Todos los Santos (Spanish, 'All Saints'), and sometimes Araw ng mga Patay / 
            Yumao (Tagalog, 'Day of the Dead, passed away'), which incorporates All Saints' Day and All Souls' 
            Day. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting their families' graves to clean and repair 
            the tombs. Prayers for the dead are recited, while offerings are made, the most common being 
            flowers, candles, food, and for Chinese Filipinos, incense and kim. Many also spend the day and 
            ensuing night holding reunions at the graves with feasting and merriment.

            <b>Pangangaluluwa and Trick-or-treat</b><br>
            Though Halloween is usually seen as an American influence, the country's trick-or-treat traditions 
            during Undas are actually much older. This tradition was derived from the pre-colonial tradition of 
            pangangaluluwa. From káluluwâ ('spirit double'), it was a practice of early Filipinos, swathed in 
            blankets, going from house to house, and singing as they pretended to be the spirits of ancestors. 
            If the owner of the house failed to give biko or rice cakes to the nangángalúluwâ, the "spirits" 
            would play tricks (such as stealing slippers or other objects left outside the house, or run off 
            with the family's chickens). Pangángaluluwâ practices are still seen in some rural areas.

            <b>Cemetery and reunion practices</b><br>
            During Undas, families visit the graves of loved ones. It is believed that by going to the cemetery 
            and offering food, candles, flowers, and sometimes incense, the spirits are remembered and appeased. 
            Contrary to common belief, this visitation practice is not an imported tradition. Prior to the use 
            of coffins, pre-colonial Filipinos were already visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago 
            as confirmed by research conducted by the University of the Philippines. The tradition of atang or 
            hain is also practiced, where food and other offerings are placed at the gravesite. If the family 
            cannot visit, a specific area in the house is set aside for ritual offerings.
            <br><br>
            The present date of Undas, 1 November, is not a pre-colonial observance but an import from Mexico, 
            where it is known as the Day of the Dead. Pre-colonial Filipinos preferred going to the burial 
            caves of the departed occasionally as they believed that aswáng (monster, half-vampire, half-werewolf 
            beings) would take the corpse of the dead if it was not properly guarded. Watching over the body 
            of the dead is called "paglalamay". However, in some communities, this paglalamay tradition is 
            non-existent and is replaced by other pre-colonial traditions unique to each community.
            <br><br>
            Undas is also seen as a family holiday, where members living elsewhere return to their hometowns 
            to visit ancestral graves. Family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire 
            ay and socialize with each other to strengthen ties. In some cases, family members going to graves 
            may exceed one hundred people. Fighting in any form is taboo during Undas.

            <b>Role of children</b><br>
            Children are allowed to play with melted candles left at tombs, which they form into wax balls. 
            The round balls symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began, as the 
            living will return to dust from whence it came. In some cases, families also light candles by 
            the front door, their number equivalent to the number of departed loved ones. It is believed 
            that the lights aid the spirits and guide them to the afterlife.
