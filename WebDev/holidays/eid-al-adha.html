        <p>
            On Eid al-Adha, Muslims demonstrate their obedience to Allah by sacrificing an animal. The holiday 
            is inspired by a story from the Quran that is also known to Christians and Jews.
            <br><br>
            Eid al-Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice) is a public holiday. It is a day off for the general population, 
            and schools and most businesses are closed.
            <br><br>
            In 2025, it falls on a Saturday, and some businesses may choose to follow Saturday opening hours.
