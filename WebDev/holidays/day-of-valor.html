                <i>Araw ng Kagitingan</i>, also known as the Day of Valor, marks the greatness of Filipino

            <h2>What Do People Do?</h2>
            <p>
                Araw ng Kagitingan is a non-working holiday that is part of a long weekend in the Philippines. 
                World War II veterans parade in different cities in the Philippines on this day. There are small 
                parades in different localities in the Philippines but the Araw ng Kagitingan’s main highlight occurs
                when the country’s president gives a speech at the Mt Samat shrine, in the Bataan province, to 
                commemorate the heroism of the Filipinos and American troops during the World War II.
            </p>

            <h2>Public Life</h2>
            <p>
                Araw ng Kagitingan is a regular holiday in the Philippines and occurs on or around April 9. 
                Many streets are closed and public transport routes may be redirected to give way for parades. 
                Malls and other leisure areas remain open and most people may go to these places and use this day 
                as a family day.
            </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The Day of Valor, also known as Araw ng Kagitingan, commemorates the heroism of Filipinos and American 
                Soldiers when the Japanese occupied the Philippines during World War II. Major General Edward P. King, 
                of the United States Army, was forced to surrender more than 76,000 Filipinos, Chinese and American 
                soldiers to the Japanese at dawn on April 9, 1942. The soldiers were forced to take a 90-mile (about 
                145 kilometers) hike to Camp O’Donnell in San Fernando. Thousands of prisoners died during the hike 
                (also known as the Bataan Death March) due to starvation, dehydration and diseases before they could 
                reach the camp.
                <br><br>
                Despite the trials of defeat, the captured soldiers stood strong and heroes emerged from the event. 
                The surrender of Bataan hastened the fall of Corregidor. However, without this stand, the Japanese 
                might have quickly overrun all of the US bases in the Pacific. Bataan forced them to slow down, 
                giving the allies valuable time to prepare for conflicts such as the Battle of the Coral Sea and 
                the Battle of Midway, which followed closely thereafter. American and Filipino liberation forces 
                eventually retook the Bataan peninsula on February 8, 1945.
                <br><br>
                The Day of Valor was a national observance until a Letter of Instruction No. 1087, dated on November 
                26, 1980, made “Araw ng Kagitingan” a national public holiday to honor the people who helped bring 
                democracy and freedom in the Philippines during the World War II era. Executive Order No. 203, dated 
                on June 30, 1987, further proclaimed April 9 as “Araw Ng Kagitingan” to pay tribute to the heroes of 
                Bataan, Corregidor and Bessang.
